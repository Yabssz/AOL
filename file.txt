Description 
Micro, Small, and Medium Enterprises (UMKM) play a vital role in driving economic growth and job creation. However, many UMKM struggle to access the funding needed to expand their businesses. ModalRakyat aims to bridge this gap through a crowdfunding platform that connects UMKM with potential investors. By providing easier access to capital, this initiative supports entrepreneurship, promotes financial inclusion, and contributes to Sustainable Development Goal 8 (Decent Work and Economic Growth) by fostering business growth, creating job opportunities, and strengthening the local economy.
